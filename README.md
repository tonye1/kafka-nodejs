# kafka-nodejs
I had a lot of problems gettting this to work

A couple of things

I needed to install a new copy of apple command line developer tools to build the C framework
Need node-rdkafka 2.11.0 to work (or even to build)
Need to download the PEM cert es-cert.pem and list that directory in the app.js
Need to change line 197 in app.js to reduce the number of brokers from 3 to 1
